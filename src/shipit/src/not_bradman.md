But you’re not Bradman Since you’re not impossibly good at the core skill involved in this project, how will things be different? What will you bring to this project that someone who is truly gifted might not?
Okay, let’s try again. Given that you’re not the Michelangelo of this domain, the Julia Child or even the William Shatner, how can you possibly hope to have a breakthrough? e only solution is to find edges others haven’t found, to bring a dynamic others are afraid of. What’s yours?
