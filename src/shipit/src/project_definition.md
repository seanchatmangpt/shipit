# ProjectDefinition

What’s the project? (Make ‘the project’ manageable, finite, time-dated and do-able (or failable). Subprojects are fine.) If you can’t write it down, you don’t have a project.
When does it ship?
Please give a date and a time.
Who is responsible for shipping it?
You can list team members, but only one person is responsible. Put a * next to her name.
