Smart meetings checklist
Would skipping this meeting impede our ability to ship? Could it be a wiki or Basecamp meeting instead?
If we have to have the meeting, can we do it in a room with no chairs?
Can we invite fewer people? How few?
What’s the purpose of this meeting? Pick one of the following, and you can only pick one. If it’s more than one, skip the meeting.
• Inform people about the project
• Learn opinions or facts that will help you ship
• Discuss the project and gain input from interested parties
• Pitch or approve the idea
After we’re finished, how will we know if the meeting was a success?
