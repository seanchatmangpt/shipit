# Competition

Who becomes your competition?
(One reason to hesitate is that shipping something opens you to criticism.
Another, sneakier reason to hesitate is that shipping also opens you to competition,
to people who will then try to overcome your lead, putting you into a race.
So, who is about to compete with you?)
