e system we grew up with is a mess. It’s falling apart at the seams and a lot of people I care about (maybe you) are in pain because the things we thought would work, don’t. Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. ey have become victims, pawns in a senseless system that uses them up and undervalues them.
It’s about a choice and it’s about your life. is choice doesn’t require you to quit your job, though it challenges you to rethink how you do your job. It’s time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map.
Stop settling for what’s good enough and start creating art that matters. Stop asking what’s in it for you and start giving gifts that change people. en, and only then, will you have achieved your potential.
For hundreds of years, the population has been seduced, scammed and brainwashed into fitting in, following instructions and exchanging a day’s work for a day’s pay. at era has come to an end, and just in time.
You have brilliance in you, your contribution is valuable, and the art you create is precious. Only you can do it, and you must. I’m hoping you’ll stand up and choose to make a difference.
